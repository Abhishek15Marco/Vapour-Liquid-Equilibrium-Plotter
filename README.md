# Vapour-Liquid-Equilibrium-Plotter
This project is a Python-based tool for plotting Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) curves of binary mixtures using Raoult’s Law and the Antoine Equation. It helps visualize how ethanol-water systems behave at different compositions, which is essential in distillation, separation processes, and chemical engineering studies.

Features
Plots vapor pressure curves for binary mixtures (Ethanol–Water).
Implements Raoult’s Law for vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations.
Uses Antoine Equation for accurate vapor pressure estimation.
Provides visual insights into composition effects on vapor-liquid equilibrium.

Technologies Used
Python
Matplotlib (for visualization)
NumPy (for numerical calculations)
